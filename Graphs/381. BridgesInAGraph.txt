How to find all bridges in a given graph?
A simple approach is to one by one remove all edges and see if removal of an edge causes disconnected graph. Following are steps of simple approach for connected graph.

1) For every edge (u, v), do following
…..a) Remove (u, v) from graph
..…b) See if the graph remains connected (We can either use BFS or DFS)
…..c) Add (u, v) back to the graph.



Time complexity of above method is O(E*(V+E)) for a graph represented using adjacency list
